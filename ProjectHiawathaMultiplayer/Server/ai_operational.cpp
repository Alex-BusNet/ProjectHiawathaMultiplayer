//Current Priority Setup
/*Control of overall unit placement
    Determines if it needs to be using the unit offensively (at war)
        if not at war, determine if it should be positioning
            offensively(prep for war)
            defensively(based on 'enemy'(rival player, etc, not necessarily at war) position
        if at war, determine a priority target (nearest unit or city)
            determine if a buildup of troops is needed before an attack (combat strengths)
            Probably target nearest opponent city to our borders/any units in the way/any within our borders
                pathing may play into this*/
