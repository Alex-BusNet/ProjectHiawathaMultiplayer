/*
 * FindPath, in conjunction with GetNeighbors, GetDistance,
 * and RetracePath, uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to determine the
 * most efficient path for a unit to reach the target tile while avoiding
 * obstacles on the map. The A* pathfinding algorithm uses a heuristic cost system
 * and by calculating 'cost' to move to an adjacent tile (stored as gCost) and the distance
 * of the adjacent tile to the target tile (stored as hCost), and the summation of
 * the two (known as fCost). The algorithm determines what direction it travels by looking at
 * the fCost of all surrounding tiles and choosing the lowest one, if there is a tie in lowest
 * fCosts, then the lower hCost of the two is used, if hCosts tie, then one of the two is chosed
 * and the algorithm proceeds. Tiles that are determined to be impassable (indicated by a tile's walkable flag or the AtWar check)
 * then a gCost and hCost are not calculated for that tile. As tiles are searched, any tile that is determined
 * to be a valid tile, and has not already been searched, is added to the openSet, as tiles are checked, they are
 * added to the closedSet. As new tiles are searched and are determined to be valid options, the neighboring
 * tiles' parent attribute is set to the current tile. Tiles that have been determined to be part of the path will
 * always a higher fCost, preventing the algorithm from revistiing a tile it has already visited. Once FindPath
 * reaches it's destination the end tile and start tile are sent to RetracePath.
